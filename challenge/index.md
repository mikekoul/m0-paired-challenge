## Workflow

- Michael drove and Kevin navigated. We got stuck on whether needed to declare new variables after the six but decided to move forward keeping the variables we had and defining them. I made sure to look up annotation and make sure it was asking us to leave a note. With so much technical knowledge being thrown around just wanted to be sure. We were able to effectively agree and move on to the next step.
